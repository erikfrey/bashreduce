h2. bashreduce : mapreduce in a bash script

bashreduce lets you apply your favorite unix tools in a mapreduce fashion across multiple machines/cores.  There's no installation, administration, or distributed filesystem.  You'll need:

* "br":http://github.com/erikfrey/bashreduce/blob/master/br somewhere handy in your path
* gnu core utils on each machine: sort, awk, grep
* netcat on each machine

h2. Configuration

If you wish, you may edit @/etc/br.hosts@ and enter the machines you wish to use as workers.  You can also specify this at runtime:

<pre>br -m "host1 host2 host3"</pre>

To take advantage of multiple cores, repeat the host name as many times as you wish.

h2. Examples

h3. sorting

<pre>br < input > output</pre>

h3. word count

<pre>br -r "uniq -c" < input > output</pre>

h3. count words that begin with 'b'

<pre>br -r "grep ^b | uniq -c" < input > output</pre>

h2. Performance

Completely spurious numbers, all this shows you is how useful br is to *me*   :-)

I have four compute machines and I'm usually relegated to using one core on one machine to sort.  How about when I use br?

|_. command |_. external deps |_. time |_. rate |
| sort -k1,1 4gb_file > 4gb_file_sorted@ | | 82m54.746s | 843 kBps |
| br -i 4gb_file -o 4gb_file_sorted | | 9m17.431s | 7.35 MBps |
| br -i 4gb_file -o 4gb_file_sorted | brp | 6m5.968s | 11.19 MBps |

When I have more time I'll compare this apples to apples.  There's also still a ton of room for improvement.

I'm also interested in seeing how bashreduce compares to hadoop.  Of course it won't win... but how close does it come?
